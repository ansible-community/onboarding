Welcome to the Ansible project onboarding toolkit. 
The purpose of this toolkit is to provide you with guidance as
you consider adding your project to the Ansible ecosystem of projects.
This toolkit provides guidelines on the project GitHub repository setup
as well as the type of documentation your project should include. 
It also provides a GitHub 
[repository template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template)
that you can use to create a repository in the GitHub
[ansible-community](https://github.com/ansible-community) organization.

These guidelines are specific to projects being added to the official community
Ansible ecosystem projects. This does not apply to Ansible collections or other 
projects not part of the ecosystem.
